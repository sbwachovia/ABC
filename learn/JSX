  JSX
    
    JSX example: 
   class App extends Component{
      render(){
      return(
         <div className="app">
          <p> Welcome</p>
         </div>
      );
      }
   }

JSX differences

 Note : we can't use id class  and for , so use className instead of class , use the htmlFor instead of for
 
 Class -> className
 for  -> htmlFor
 camelCase property Naming convention
 onclick -> onClick
 tabindex -> tabIndex
